## Premise

Under Grove is a procedurally generated, 2D adventure game. The purpose of this game is to educate players on unethical game design to better protect them from potentially manipulative practice. Within the game, players can add unethical design patterns to the gameplay and experiment with their effects. These settings can be shared with others to add a small social aspect to the game.

## News

**An upcoming v0.6 is forthcoming, which will feature enemy AI and additional story elements.**

## Background

The project was developed as part of my MSc dissertation and was used in an experiment to test how well the game educates people on these design patterns. Overall, players did learn more about these design patterns (although the increase was not statistically significant).

From 18-27 August, changes were made to the game on a daily basis. The current version of the game is __v0.54__.

A history of changes can be viewed in the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md).
